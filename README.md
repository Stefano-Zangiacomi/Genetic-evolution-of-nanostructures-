# Genetic-evolution-of-nanostructures

The recent development of nano-fabrication has paved the way for
nanophotonics. 
It is now possible to design nanoantennas that can
enhance the electromagnetic field at optical frequencies. 
Magnetic dipole transitions in matter are known to be orders of magnitude
weaker than their electric dipole counterparts. 
Dielectric and plasmonic nanostructures have the potential of strongly enhancing the
optical magnetic fields in the near field, making these nanostructures
ideal candidates to control and enhance the emission of magnetic
dipole transitions.

I have study using a genetic algorithm, the ability of a ring-shape nanostructure to enhance the
magnetic field at its center strongly.

The genetic algorithm is connected to the Lumerical software though its Python API.
